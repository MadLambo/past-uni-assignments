### Unit Description: 
Growing quantities of data collected by business, government, the internet and social media provide opportunities for better management and a better society through evidence-based decision-making and the provision of new services.

Students will be introduced to the discovery and analysis of social networks, social trends, and relationships amongst industry factors using spreadsheets and data visualisation software.
