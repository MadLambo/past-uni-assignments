# Justin Lam's repository of assignments and projects 
Hello and welcome to my repository. My name is Justin Lam and I am a Business Analytics graduate at Macquarie University. The following repository acts as a portfolio of mine where I showcase my assignments and projects that I have done throughout my years of studying university. Due the dynamic nature of the degree, I am able to gain in-depth training in multiple disciplines such as qualitative skills (graphic presentation and information communication), quantitative skills (modelling and statistics), computing skills (business information/intelligence systems and programming) and business training (accounting, business analytics, forecasting and management). As time proceeds, I have developed a toolbox filled with different skills and they can be applied in various circumstances.
