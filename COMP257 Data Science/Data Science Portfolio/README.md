# COMP257/ITEC657 Data Science Portfolio 
### Name: Justin Lam 
### SID: 45197083


Throughout the course of COMP257, we were given three portfolios of small data analysis problems and we are required to apply the statistical techniques that we learnt in lectures into the form of Python. These portfolios involve one or more data sets. The description of each of the data sets will be described below. 

#### Portfolio 1
The first dataset is an export of the lecturer - Steve Cassidy's bicyle ride data from [Strava](https://strava.com/), an online social network site for cycling and other sports. The data has recorded every ride since the start of 2018 and it summerises the key variables of each of the trip. Such as the distance, speed, the temperature of each of trips. Within the portfolio, we are required to conduct exploratary data analysis (EDA) - which contains creating distribution graphs, boxplots, scatter plots and correlation matrix for the key variables. 

#### Portfolio 2
Portfolio 2 was released in week 5, after regression was introduced to us. The portfolio's goal is to reproduce some work on predicting the energy usage of a house based on IoT measurements of temperature and humidity and weather observations. The target paper is:
Data driven prediction models of energy use of appliances in a low-energy house. Luis M. Candanedo, VÃ©ronique Feldheim, Dominique Deramaix. Energy and Buildings, Volume 140, 1 April 2017, Pages 81-97, ISSN 0378-778 and the data can be found via the authors' [Github Repository](https://github.com/LuisM78/Appliances-energy-prediction-data/)



#### Portfolio 3
In this portfolio, we are required to conduct k-means clusetering as it is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised learning algorithms. It is unsupervising learning algorithm because it does not have any any lables in the data. 

The portfolio will contain at least: 
- Generate four random centers;
- Visualise the clustering results in each iteration
