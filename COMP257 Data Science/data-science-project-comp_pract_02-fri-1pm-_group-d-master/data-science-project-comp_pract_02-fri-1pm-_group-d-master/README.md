## Predicting Formula 1 Drivers Salary based on pervious years performance

### Project Summary

<img src="images/f1_logo_red.svg" width=800 />

Formula 1 also know as F1, is one of the most elite sports in the world. The first F1 season was held in 1950 which means the sport has a legacy of over half a century. In 1950 there were a total of 7 races that made up the season and now in 21 the competition has expanded globally to 21 races.

We will be closely monitoring how factors such as driver age, number of world championships, pole positions and race wins will ultimately affect the drivers salary in the coming year.

### Project Goal
- Find race factors that most impact a drivers salary.
- Model previous F1 driver salaries.
- Predict 2018 driver salaries based on drivers' previous performance.
